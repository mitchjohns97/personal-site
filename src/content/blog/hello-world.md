Welcome to my blog! This is the first of what I hope will be many posts where I share what I'm learning, building, and thinking about.

## Why I'm Starting This Blog

I've been meaning to write more for a while now. There's something powerful about explaining concepts to others—it forces you to truly understand them yourself. Plus, I've learned so much from other developers' blogs that I want to pay it forward.

## What I'll Write About

I plan to cover a variety of topics:

- **Technical tutorials** - Step-by-step guides on things I've figured out
- **Project deep-dives** - Behind-the-scenes looks at what I'm building
- **Learning in public** - Sharing my journey as I learn new technologies
- **Thoughts and opinions** - My takes on tools, practices, and the industry

## A Quick Example

Here's some code, just to test that code blocks look good:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## What's Next?

I'm excited to share more soon. In the meantime, feel free to check out my [projects](/projects) or [get in touch](/contact).

Thanks for reading!
